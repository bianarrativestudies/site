This is a quick guide to help you edit the text in each page in this folder.

-- Editing in Github -- 
The quickest way to update a page is to click on the page in GitHub
and at the top right (Next to the Raw - Blame - History buttons) click the Pencil icon.

This will open the GitHub text editor. It doesn't offer any formatting (like bold, italic etc)
so you'll need to add this yourself. Examples given later.

For ease of editing, again at the top right change the "No Wrap" button to "Soft Wrap" so you
don't have to scroll horizontally on long lines of text.

Once you've finished editing a document, scroll down to the bottom of the screen and click "Commit Changes".
There is no need to add anything in the comments, but you can if you want to explain the changes you've
made. Otherwise leave everything as default and hit Commit Changes. You should then see the website update
with your changes within a few minutes.

-- Pages --
Each page of the website has its own file. These are located in the "pages" folder and end with .html

Most of the time you'll only be interested in the main section of the page. This can be found just
after the <!-- Main --> comment line about halfway down.

While the text should be obvious, a small amount of HTML knowledge is required for formatting
paragraphs, line breaks and headers etc.

You'll need to surround your text with HTML tags, which look like <this></this>. Notice especially
the forward slash before the name of the last tag! Anything between the tags will be formatted
depending on the kind of tag you use.

The most common and useful tags are:

<b>This text will show as bold</b>

<i>This text will show as italic</i>

<p>This is a regular paragraph of text. It forces a line break after it. Used for regular text</p>

<h3>This is a header. Same as paragraph but text is bigger. Used as a title.</h3>

Some special tags:

<hr /> creates a horizontal rule, basically a line spanning the width of the page.

<br /> creates a line break. This is done automatically after <p> and <h3> tags but you can use it
if you need more space.
